-- The product pivots from WhatsApp automation to email as the outreach
-- channel: sending by hand-scripted WhatsApp Web sessions carried real ban
-- risk, and the official Cloud API required business verification the owner
-- didn't want to pursue. Phone stays the contact's immortal identity (it's
-- what every data source reliably gives us) — email is an enrichment field,
-- best-effort scraped from the business's own website, filled in later, or
-- entered by hand when scraping finds nothing.
ALTER TABLE contact_points
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS email text;

-- Email needs a subject line; the WhatsApp Cloud template mapping is now
-- dead weight since nothing sends through that gateway anymore.
